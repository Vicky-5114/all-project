Fly me to the moon
    And let me play among the stars
let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars
In other words hold my hand~
    In other words Darling kiss me~
Fill my heart with song
    And let me sing forever more
You are all I long for all I worship and adore
    In other words Please be true
In other words I love you
                Fly me to the moon
    And let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars
        In other words hold my hand
In other words Darling kiss me
    Fill my heart with song
    And let me sing forever more
                    You are all I long for all I worship and adore
    In other words Please be true
In other words I love you
